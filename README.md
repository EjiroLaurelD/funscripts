# FUN SCRIPTS 
This repository contains  scripts I played around with in the process of learning bashscript. I created scripts that predicts the age you become a millionaire, scripts to get the weather from cities, number game, pushup counts etc. This project is open for contributions in anyform to make it better and bring it to life.

Have fun contributing to it.
